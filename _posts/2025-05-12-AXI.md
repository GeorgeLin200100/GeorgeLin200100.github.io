### AXI AxREGION信号

#### purpose

 to support interfaces with multiple address regions within a single interface

- can identify up to 16 different regions
- the region identifier provides a decode of higher-order address bits
- a single physical interface on a Subordinate can provide multiple logical interfaces, each with a different location in the system address map.
- usage:
  - *A peripheral can have its main data path and control registers at different locations in the address map, and be accessed through a single interface without the need for the Subordinate to perform an address decode.*
  - A Subordinate can exhibit different behaviors in different memory regions. For example, a Subordinate might provide read and write access in one region, but read-only access in another region

#### AXI Response信号

AXI provides response signaling for both read and write transactions.

For read transactions, the response information from the subordinate is signaled on the read data channel using RRESP.

For write transactions, the response information is signaled on the write response channel using BRESP.

RRESP and BRESP are both composed of two bits, and the encoding of these signals can transfer four responses, as shown in the following table:

| Response code | Description                                                  |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 00 - OKAY     | Normal access success or exclusive access failure.OKAY is the response that is used for most transactions. OKAY indicates that a normal access has been successful.This response can also indicate that an exclusive access has failed. An exclusive access is when more than one manager can access a subordinate at once, but the se managers cannot access the same memory range. |
| 01 - EXOKAY   | Exclusive access okay.EXOKAY indicates that either the read or write portion of an exclusive access has been successful. |
| 10 - SLVERR   | Subordinate error.SLVERR is used when the access has reached the subordinate successfully, but the subordinate wants to return an error condition to the originating manager.This indicates an unsuccessful transaction. For example, when there is an unsupported transfer size attempted, or a write access attempted to read-only location. |
| 11 - DECERR   | Decode error.DECERR is often generated by an interconnect component to indicate that there is no subordinate at the transaction address. |
